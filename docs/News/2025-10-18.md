# Guidelines for Electrifying the Bus System in Hong Kong

Based on the scenario analysis results, we make the following recommendations on bus electrification in Hong Kong:

- Spatial Discrepancies in the Need for Charging Infrastructure
According to our baseline scenario, Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin, and Kwun Tong require more charging stations than other districts. Furthermore, we observed inconsistencies between fast and slow chargers in certain areas. For instance, the airport region hosts a greater number of fast chargers than slow chargers, likely due to limited charging windows compared with the extended operational hours of the airport shuttle route, thereby necessitating high-power chargers for rapid energy replenishment.
- Alternative electrification approaches for areas and routes prone to high delays
Even when minimizing delays is set as the primary optimization objective, charging-related delays cannot be completely avoided. These delays display significant spatial and temporal variations, typically peaking between 18:00 and 24:00, especially in Sheung Shui, Tuen Mun, Tseung Kwan O, and Kwai Chung. Given constraints on land availability and budget constraint, mitigating such delays by expanding facilities or fleet size is likely to be infeasible. We thus recommend deploying alternative decarbonization strategies in these areas and on the corresponding routes, such as hydrogen fuel cell buses, which can drastically reduce refueling time.
- Battery capacity as a key factor in alleviating delays
Our results show that doubling battery capacity reduces the average delay caused by charging from 4.5 to 2.6 minutes. Conversely, when battery capacity declines to 60%, the average delay surges to 17.8 minutes. These findings indicate that battery technological innovations will help mitigate the queuing issue for charging. More importantly, to prevent severe operational disruptions caused by battery degradation, bus operators can set the threshold (or timing) for battery replacement based on the relationship between battery capacity and delay.
- Faster charging speeds facilitate fleet downsizing
Enhancing charging speeds not only reduces delays but can also lower overall fleet requirements. For example, raising fast-charging power from 120 kW to 600 kW could save the capital cost of approximately 1,000 battery electric buses, leading to a reduction in the total system cost. Consequently, we recommend installing high-power chargers (>120kW) at high demand charging stations.
- Rising electricity prices demand more energy-efficient models
Although energy-efficient buses are more expensive, they consume less energy per distance. This reduced energy consumption can offset higher electricity prices, thereby helping to control the total system cost. Should electricity prices in Hong Kong increase in the future, stakeholders (e.g., bus companies) could consider raising the proportion of high-efficiency vehicles in bus fleets.
- Increasing charging infrastructure costs favor longer-range models
As the cost of charging facilities escalates, the optimal strategy shifts away from installing more charging stations and toward acquiring buses with longer range, thereby decreasing the overall charging demand. If the costs of charging facilities or land continue to rise, bus operators may opt for long-range vehicle models in higher proportions.
Notably, the simulation platform (eBusSim) serves as a quantitative analytical tool to test the feasibility and practicality of various policy options, providing key indicators (e.g., required fleet size, vehicle models, and time delays) for different bus electrification strategies.
